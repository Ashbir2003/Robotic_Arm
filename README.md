# PICK AND PLACE ROBOTIC ARM ðŸ¤–

## ABSTRACT
To design and implement WiFi controlled pick and place robotic arm used in 
industrial purpose that can operate manually by a phone application. The system 
includes ESP3266. The robotâ€™s actions are controlled by an Android application that 
works on the Blynk platform, enabling users to provide instructions to the robot via 
their phone. The robot can follow the instructions given by the user through the 
Android Blynk App, allowing for easy and convenient control of the robotâ€™s 
movements and actions. The systemâ€™s processor makes the solution for industrial 
automation tasks, which can be performed by the robot. the system aims to automate 
various tasks and eliminate human error and to increase the work efficiency
